### Our team has the vision for a good mentally sound environment around us so that a great nation could flourish at its best. 
## Problem : 
  Mental health is the most underrated and **neglected problem of Indian society** and its culture. Which causes devastating outcomes like intense ***depression*** or sometimes ***suicidal thoughts***. Also, people don't consider Mental problems as a health issue. So, to overcome this we present you the solution.

## The Inspiration :
 Our inspiration to solve this huge problem was **"us"** the students and all the youth who is suffering from an invisible yet dangerous problem. We are not able express ourselves in front of our loved ones as we feel **alienated** and sometimes we have a **fear of judgement** too. That's why we wanted to create a community which is not judgement biased and we have a platform to share our thoughts plus issues with them and get the **best possible solution**.

## Solution: 
We have built **Butterfly**, a one-stop solution to all Mental Health Problems. **Butterfly** is an android application that helps people live **healthy**, **peaceful**, and **colorful lives**.
But most people say that we have a lot of apps like this and they are super cool but still, users don't use them, so to overcome this issue we have created a ***Feature of Reward System***. 
With this system's help, we will give our users rewards for being more engaged in the community by partnering with companies. So with a brief about our app let's move to all the major features we give and how we made them.

1. **Community**: Community is a place where anyone can share their thoughts and we know that this sometimes can be personal so we take privacy as our priority and provides *Anonymous Posts*. 

2. **Music**: We all know there is nothing better than Music Therapy to get instant *calmness*, so we have music to *soothe* your mind.

3. **Appointment**: Sometimes people want professional help so to cover them we have included a *Doctor's Appointment*.

4. **Rewards**: For being active in the community and helping others you will get rewards like a free consultation and if wanna **share** that then that too is just a click away.

## Impact:

We are going to make a difference in the Indian society which is not inclined towards mental health issues and give the youth and other generation of India a platform to freely share themselves, also get their issues plus problems be heard by others and get it resolved too.

Butterfly is going to solve the issue of mental health and well being in a creative manner and hence make a huge impact on the society.

## Future Goals:

- Peaceful games are to be included, making the application more engaging and make the user more relieved.
- Motivational videos from professionals are also to be included in the future updates of the application.
- A Post-Coronavirus general FAQ will be also included so that the users could get themselves in a better place.
