        <h2>Covid Alert</h2>
        <p>It is a free resource developed by <b>First Year students of Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology</b> to facilitate government agencies to prevent the spread of novel Coronavirus. Our software detects the people who are not following social
            distancing and who are not wearing a mask. Thus, making the task of government agencies a lot easier. It helps to maintain law and order. We also provide the protocols issued by government agencies for the ease of the user so that they always
            follow the Covid- 19 norms. Information about number of Covid cases is updated daily here. Moreover, we also provide a piece of advice to the user about how to make a safer choice. We also provide latest news updates in video format. You can
            also get doctor’s advice and a great general knowledge about covid-19.</p>
