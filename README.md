## About The Project
The event of the creation of the vaccine gave hope to everyone across the world. But now in a country with 1.2 Billion people, vaccinating the population becomes a gargantuan task to handle this we have created a complete solution right from people looking for the nearest vaccine centers to handling the crowd at the vaccination centers.

The system created includes a wide variety of advanced features such as 
1. <b>Medinal Assistance/Inbuilt video calling functionality</b>: To facilitate faster communication between the authorities and the people we have included video calling to ensure faster resolution of queries.
2. <b>Live Geo-Location-based Tracking</b>: To help find the nearest vaccination center for the person. To know the distance and time it takes to reach the location.
3. <b>Covid-19 detection using X-ray</b>: Leveraging computer vision and deep learning we have created a system to help detect covid-19.
4. <b>Chatbot</b>- Used for helping people having any issues or queries regarding the vaccine.
5. <b>CCTV Surveillance application</b>: Using state-of-the-art object detection and facial-recognition deep learning systems we have created an application to detect social distancing violations and also activity recognition in case of any event such as crowding to maybe even violence occurs we notify the authorities using push notifications and email. The system is connected to the backend of the application and the information is also displayed on the vaccination centers admin page.

## Folders and Project Information

Dataset is something big here so you can get it at : https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1AXuV3OIxdkdXN3soig-xV-vOSSW9qep4

there is one folder named "Dataset" which you have to paste within the  folder name "Covid-Detection-X-ray".
and one more file is there with named "yolov3.weights" which you supposed to paste in **social-distance -> yolo-coco**. 

1.) Medical Assistance/ video Calling Functionality: This functionality can be accessible from the folder named Video-Calling. there are sender and reciever folders which is used for the particular module. <b>Patient can submit the form through the main index.html file and then they can join from the same at the Alloted time</b>
 Usage: 
 i) can be used by the patient already admitted into Hospitals to interact with the officials.
 ii) can also be  accessible for a normal Covid-19 related issues.
 
2.) Live Geo-Location-based Tracking: A integrated MAP can be accessible at the front page of our main File "index.html" file.

3.) Covid-19 detection using X-ray: if's all files and folders are in "Covid-Detection-X-ray" folder. you can go to "run_from_here" folder there and run **Python python_run.py** in CMD. 

4.) Chatbot: for solving the general queries, A Chatbot can be accessible at the front page of our main File "index.html" file.

5.) CCTV Surveillance application: its a **Admin** theme so it can not be available on Front-end but we have a Dashboard which you can see by moving to the "social-distance" and run **Python main_file.py**
